GoogleSheet: Cycle Detection in a Graph Component Matrix
Project Description
This project, GoogleSheet, is a JavaScript-based implementation of cycle detection in a directed graph represented as a Graph Component Matrix. The program is designed to analyze a matrix structure, where each cell contains a list of its directed edges, and determine whether the graph contains a cycle.

Key Features
Graph Representation: The graph is represented as a 2D matrix. Each cell contains an array of directed edges to other cells.
Cycle Detection Algorithm: The program employs Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
Node State Tracking: Each node maintains two states:
Visited: Tracks whether the node has been visited during the traversal.
DFS Visited: Tracks nodes in the current DFS path to identify back edges, which indicate a cycle.
How It Works
Input Matrix: The program takes a 2D array (graphComponentMatrix) as input, where each cell contains an array of its neighboring nodes.
Traversal: It iterates through all nodes in the matrix, starting a DFS traversal from unvisited nodes.
Cycle Detection:
If a back edge is detected (a node in the current DFS path is revisited), a cycle is identified.
The traversal continues until all nodes are visited.
Result: Outputs whether a cycle exists in the graph.
Example Usage
The following matrix represents a graph with a cycle:

javascript
Copy code
const graphComponentMatrix = [
  [[], [[1, 0]]],
  [[[1, 1]], [[1, 0]]],
];
Node (0,1) points to Node (1,0).
Node (1,0) points back to Node (0,1), forming a cycle.
The program outputs:

sql
Copy code
Cycle detection result: true
Technologies Used
Language: JavaScript

# README for Data Sources Query System

## Overview
This project is a web-based query system that enables users to search and summarize information from multiple data source documentation websites. Built using Python and Streamlit, it integrates web scraping, semantic search, and text summarization techniques.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapes text data from specified URLs.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits scraped content into manageable chunks for processing.
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieves the most relevant content chunks based on user queries using FAISS.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes the retrieved content for user-friendly responses.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for user queries and response display.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `faiss`
  - `numpy`
  - `transformers`
  - `streamlit`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open the application in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
3. Enter a query in the input box and press **Submit** to get results.

## Code Structure
- `urls`: List of data source documentation URLs to be scraped.
- `scrape_website(url)`: Function to fetch and extract textual content from a URL.
- `split_text(text, chunk_size, overlap)`: Function to split text into chunks for better processing.
- `setup_pipeline()`: Loads and caches the models, prepares the FAISS index, and initializes the summarization pipeline.
- `query_pipeline(user_query)`: Searches the FAISS index for the most relevant chunks based on user queries.
- `generate_response(retrieved_texts, user_query)`: Summarizes the retrieved chunks and generates a response.
- Streamlit interface: Provides a user-friendly UI for queries and responses.

## How It Works
1. **Scraping and Preprocessing**:
   - The script fetches and preprocesses text from specified documentation URLs.
   - Text is split into smaller chunks for semantic indexing.

2. **Semantic Indexing**:
   - Text chunks are encoded into embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`.
   - FAISS is used to index these embeddings for efficient semantic search.

3. **Query and Summarization**:
   - User queries are converted into embeddings and matched against the indexed chunks.
   - Top matching chunks are summarized using the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model.

4. **Interactive UI**:
   - Users can submit queries via a Streamlit-powered web interface.
   - Results are displayed as concise summaries.

## Example Query
1. Start the Streamlit app.
2. Enter a query like:
   > "How does Segment handle data tracking?"
3. View the summarized response derived from relevant documentation.

## Notes
- Ensure the URLs provided in the `urls` list are accessible and contain relevant textual data.
- Modify `chunk_size` and `overlap` in `split_text` for optimal chunking based on content characteristics.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more complex queries.
- Implement caching for scraped content to avoid repeated requests.
- Enhance UI with additional features like keyword highlighting.
- Extend support for other languages or domain-specific models.
